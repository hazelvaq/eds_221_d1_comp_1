```

Lets make some file paths - Read in data

```{r}
# Dont use read.csv use read_csv it makes some assumptions

energy <- read_csv("data/us_energy.csv")
```

Create a line chart of energy over time, with color based on the energy type

```{r}
ggplot(data = energy, aes(x = year, y = energy$quadrillion_btu)) + geom_line()

# weird stepsize we forgot to mention the grouping by the type 
# we do that by adding group = in aes()
ggplot(data = energy, aes(x = year, y = energy$quadrillion_btu,group = type, color = year)) + geom_line()

## Or set the color aesthetic to the geom 

ggplot(data = energy, aes(x = year, y = energy$quadrillion_btu)) + geom_line(aes(color = type))
```
