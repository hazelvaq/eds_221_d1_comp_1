## How to point to multiple files 

This file is in Analysis and how would you point to the Data file that is in the file before this one

```{r}
#This will not work bc the file is upstream (this is asking to look downstream)
energy2 <- read_csv("../data/us_energy.csv")

# This will allow you to go back one folder
energy2 <- read_csv("../data/us_energy.csv")

# You can do this for multiple back file paths "../../../"



```
